# Lizzie's travel Blog

### Not being able to travel this year has given me a _lot_ of time to think about past vacations and where I would like to travel in the future! Below are a few places that I've visited and some that are on my list for when it's safe to venture out into the world again.

## International Travel...
* Greece
* US Virgin Islands
* Mexico
* Israel
* Canada

I studied abroad in Athens, Greece while in college and attended their CYA program. To check them out click [here](https://www.cyathens.org/)!
I didn't get to spend as much time exploring the islands as I would have liked. One of my favorite islands that I did get to visit was Sifnos. This was one of my favorite places to visit.

## Domestic Travel...
* Washington Coast
* Oregon Coast
* San Diego, CA
* New York, New York
* Key West, Florida
* Dodge City, KS

I think that my domestic travel history isn't quite as exciting as my international travel history! Many of my vacations in the US are to visit family members or for short weekend trips with my fiance and pup.

## Future Travel Wishlist
1. Rome,Italy
2. Kyoto, Japan
3. Banff, Canada
4. Even going back to the Oregon Coast would be *amazing* during this crazy physical distancing time!
